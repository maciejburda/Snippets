  /// - returns: 64-bit unsigned integer conversion of time interval scaled and
  ///   rounded to whole nanoseconds, suitable for Grand-Central Dispatch
  ///   functions. The resulting integer is unsigned even though the
  ///   double-precision time interval used as the source can actually be
  ///   signed, e.g. negative intervals might represent _elapsed_ spans of
  ///   time. This method always ignores the sign however by first converting
  ///   the double-precision interval to an absolute double.
